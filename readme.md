##### In this project there are two dockerized App. One is created using Express and another one is created using Koa.

There are two individual Dockerfiles

And there is a docker compose file too. In that file there is set up for express and koa but one is commented out.
If you need one app, please select it's own code and comment out the other one.

#### I have deleted the nodemodules from both projects. Dont forget to run npm install first.

Thanks from Mohsin.
Happy Hacking!!!
